# Predicting Future-Term Student Performance Based on Historical Enrollment Data

## Abstract

The higher education sector has vast amounts of unexplored data that can be used to drive decision making and better inform student success initiatives for undergraduate students. Student success can be measured objectively by using historical enrollment data to predict future-term undergraduate course outcomes for students enrolled in a degree seeking capacity at a higher education institution. The objective of this project is to predict whether a student will pass or fail an undergraduate course based on historical enrollment attributes, demographic data, and specific course grades. This information has the potential to facilitate the development of targeted student success programs to help students proactively by providing them with the support and resources they need to succeed. 

## Background

Student performance in undergraduate courses is important not only for the purpose of pushing the needle on a metric but also due to the impact that this first exposure to college has on the future success of a learner. Research shows that the drop-out rate for undergraduate college students in the United States is 40%, with college freshmen and sophomores making up 30% of that rate. One of the reasons stated for dropping out of college is being unprepared for the academic workload that the student is required to take. These students are then discouraged and delayed in their academic careers by having to take remedial courses which often leads to financial impacts and late graduation [3]. It is for this reason that by focusing on student success initiatives will not only lead to a more prepared student overall but also to an increase in BOG metrics as an effect of good student performance.
